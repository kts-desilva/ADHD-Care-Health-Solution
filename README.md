ADHD-Care system provides functionalities to as a support tool for identifying possible ADHD subjects from the patient test records. The main data types considered for this study are functional Magnetic Resonance Data (fMRI) and eye movement data. 

For this experiment, users can use the system functionalities without a user account. However, the user gets a patient ID for the first time he/she uses the ADHD-Care services. Later, this patient ID can be used to track their records in the ADHD-Care application. 
Psychiatrists can sign up for an account and login to add patient details under that account and view the patient history via the psychiatric portal.
